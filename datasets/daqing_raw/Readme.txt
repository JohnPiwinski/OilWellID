## NEPU_OWOD v1.0

### Introduction

```
NEPU_OWOD-1.0 (Northeast Petroleum University - Oil Well Object Detection)  covers an area of 369 square kilometres and includes 1192 oil wells in 432 images (with a resolution of 0.41m per pixel).  The images are 768 * 768 pixels, 768 * 1024 pixels and 1024 * 1024 pixels. 
The format of the data set complies with the VOC2007 format:
